# Formula 1 Sentiment Analysis Project

## üìñ Overview

This project analyzes Formula 1-related comments from YouTube to assess audience sentiment regarding racers, teams, and races. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, the project extracts insights on fan perceptions, emotional trends, and team popularity across the 2024 season. The analysis includes advanced sentiment classification, emotional engagement analysis, and comparative sentiment visualization for top racers and teams.

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Workflow

1. **Data Collection**  
   - Scraped YouTube comments from 20 race-related videos, accumulating 100,000 comments, focusing on sentiment around drivers, teams, and race events.
   
2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Cleaned the data by removing irrelevant comments, stopwords, and special characters using **NLTK**.
   - Filtered comments mentioning specific racers and teams using a predefined list of keywords, ensuring relevance.
   
3. **Sentiment Analysis**  
   - Used **NRC Lexicon** for emotion classification into categories like joy, sadness, anger, fear, and surprise.
   - Implemented **Hugging Face** for multilabel sentiment analysis, identifying different sentiments for the same comment where multiple racers were mentioned (e.g., joy for one driver and anger for another).

4. **Visualization**  
   - Created detailed plots to depict racer and team sentiment trends, emotional engagement, and comparative analysis using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.
   - Developed interactive dashboards using **PySpark** to visualize insights and support decision-making for teams and sponsors.
