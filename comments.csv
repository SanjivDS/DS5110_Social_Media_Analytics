Everyone has big dreams, goals and plans on this short time we have under the sun, but I want to also inform you that the most important thing to accomplish in this Life is to know your Creator and to do His will. After life on this Rock ends it is not over. We must be Judged my Jesus Christ. <br><br>2Cor.5:10 For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.<br><br>Eccl.<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Tm6Z1y3h94&amp;t=733"">12:13</a>-14 Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.  For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.<br><br>Below it shows us that God is the God of the living describing Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. All three are dead in the flesh, but Alive Spiritually. In the end there will be a Resurrection of the good and bad. The good will come out of Paradise to be taken into Heaven and the bad will be taken out of Hell to be put in the Lake of Fire.<br><br>Matt.<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Tm6Z1y3h94&amp;t=1350"">22:30</a>-33 For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven. But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living. And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his doctrine.<br><br>Rev.20:13-15 And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works. And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.<br><br>John.<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Tm6Z1y3h94&amp;t=328"">5:28</a>-29 Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.<br><br>God sent down His only begotten Son (John.<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Tm6Z1y3h94&amp;t=196"">3:16</a>) to die for our sins.. He took our sins in his body (1Peter.<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Tm6Z1y3h94&amp;t=144"">2:24</a>), Crucified the Old Law to the Cross (Hebrews.<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Tm6Z1y3h94&amp;t=555"">9:15</a>-17), purchased the church with His own blood (Acts.<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Tm6Z1y3h94&amp;t=1227"">20:27</a>-28) and broke the wall of partition between Jew and Gentile (Ephesians.<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Tm6Z1y3h94&amp;t=134"">2:14</a>) <br><br>To be saved one must hear that Jesus died on that cross for the purposes listed above. That is the good news! He commanded that all nations be taught, that they believe, repent and be baptized for the remission of sins and to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. <br><br>Acts.<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Tm6Z1y3h94&amp;t=158"">2:38</a> Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.<br><br>Matt.<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Tm6Z1y3h94&amp;t=1698"">28:18</a>-20 And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:<br><br>Jesus will add you to the church in the Bible the church of Christ....<br><br>Acts.<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Tm6Z1y3h94&amp;t=167"">2:47</a> Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.<br><br>Matthew.<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Tm6Z1y3h94&amp;t=978"">16:18</a> And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.<br><br>Ephesians.4:4-6 There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling; One Lord, one faith, one baptism, One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all.<br><br>Romans.<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Tm6Z1y3h94&amp;t=976"">16:16</a> Salute one another with an holy kiss. The churches of Christ salute you.<br><br>I pray you take heed and visit a church of Christ in your area, ask questions on what you have to do to be saved and request for Biblical examples and answers on how they were saved in the New Testament after Christ died, buried and resurrected. If you desire to learn more or have a question, please search on our channel for a topic and most likely we have a video on it.

It‚Äôs easy to get caught up in the cycle of stress and anxiety, but this video is a great reminder to focus on what we can control and let go of the rest. I loved the point about how worrying doesn&#39;t change the outcome but does drain our energy. It‚Äôs all about mindset‚Äî shifting from worry to action, or even just being present, can really transform how we experience challenges.

Then bam you have your first memory (maybe you busted your eye open or stepped on a nail or something traumatic as a kid), you grow up and the days seem to last forever. I remember summer break used to seem like a year. Then when you get older the dys and years just fly by. Dont ever put goals off until later. There will come a time when its definitely too late.and you think back to those things with regret. Dont live for regrets. Take that cruise vacation you keep putting off, go back and finish your degree, get married and make some babies, learn to play an instrument or a new language, buy that new car youve had your eye on, whatever. There will come a day when the lights go out and youll never know anything again. Its kind of a beautiful thing, but its also depressing. We&#39;re the only beings that even ponder these things. A monkey doesn&#39;t ask why when he eats a piece of fruit. He just does. My cats dont worry. They just sit in my life and probably think that will lsst forever. Man.."

@karil7285,2024-04-12T01:12:25Z,2024-04-12T01:12:25Z,0,"This video made me smile. Thank you for that. Life is beautiful, yet it is scary. Life makes absolutely not sense, but life is a miracle. In the constant nothingness of the universe, luck or destiny, call it as you wish, made it possible for me to have thoughts. It made possible reflexion, emotions, self-awarness and constant questioning of what is around me. Me, the sole important charachter of my universe. Whitout me, the universe does not exist‚Ä¶for me. Perception is such an incredible thing. There is the fabric of the universe, of life, of matter, and then there is billions of different universe throught the endless perceptions of humans. There is me, has i perceive myself. But there are hundreds of differents perceptions of myself through the minds of the people that see me, that know me, that love me and that hate me. You, the reader, is creating automaticly a perception of me because you are reading my thougts. All that to say, that we have been given an incredible gift. The gift of life. It may seem short, but thats only on the scale of the universe, on the scale of history. But for a second think about all the steps you took, think about all the breath you took, all the air you still have to breath. Think about the infinity of thougts you can have. Think about all the words that came out of you mouth. Think about everything you still have to achieve. Yes the number of laps around our star that you can do in a life time are not infinite, they are a actually small number. But think for a second about all the sunrise that you will experience in your lifetime. All the minutes, all the seconds. Think about all your dreams, your wishes. Think about all you can achieve from this point on. Yes, life is absurd. But that absurdity is the magic of our existence. It is absurd only if you decide to perceive it a such. Again thank you for that video that made this reflexion possible. Tonight i will sleep peacefully thanks to you."

@arjun2340,2024-03-21T20:19:13Z,2024-03-21T20:19:13Z,0,"Really helps me. Before any task which I consider important, I always get distracted by thinking of the outcome. How people will judge me if I fail, what I will think of myself if I fail, what I will do or how I will react if i fail. Or if i suceed, how people will react, what I might feel or do etc. I end up creating possible scenarios, thoughts and feeling of how things will be after the task at hand is done- successfully or not. This really prevents me from focussing on the task and giving my 100%. Instead I focus on the result and the outcome. <br>Now whenever I am going to do something important or difficult, I listen to this. The fact that no matter wether i fail or succeed, no matter how people react and judge me based on my success or failure, no matter how I judge myself, it will all be gone. It is all pointless. However since I want to do the task and since I undertook the challenge on my own accord and since now I have to do it and since I cant back out anymore, so best to focus on the task at hand rather than the result. Because the whatever the outcome, eventually it wont matter anyways."

To understand the light (love), one must experience darkness; one cannot truly know what a thing is until it has been contrasted with its opposite. I believe we choose to come here, and sometimes not just to learn, but to help others (to teach).<br><br>Heaven is home, but once we&#39;ve enjoyed basking for eons in perfect heavenly bliss, we might look forward to a new challenge/adventure in this amazing universe. I think the soul takes on these &#39;lives&#39; just as we opt to read books or watch movies ‚Äî sometimes a comedy, other times a drama or thriller etc., ‚Äî but all for the sole purpose of learning to love. So please don&#39;t fear the process; God knows what He&#39;s doing. Don&#39;t be a backseat driver! üòä<br><br>However, I do believe that it&#39;s <b>imperative</b> that we learn to love (mercy, compassion, forgiveness, kindness, fortitude, equanimity, etc.), otherwise, experiences and even lives may <b>repeat</b> until we do so! Understandably, God always gives precedence to the soul over the body. Once we&#39;ve overcome all our challenges, I doubt we&#39;ll come here too often, if at all.<br><br>I believe that an important thing to remember is the &#39;golden thread&#39; that seems to run through most NDEs; namely, we are a part of God (His children), we&#39;re eternal, we&#39;re loved beyond measure, and we come here to learn to love. Thank goodness it&#39;s designed in such a way as to always feel like the first time!<br><br>üëâStrive to be the best version of yourself in thought, word, and deed, and you may be surprised by the abundance of blessings that come your way. Give it a try and see for yourself!<br><br>I wish you the very best in life! üíú<br><br>&quot;To find the best in others; To leave the world a bit better...

If there are gods and they are just, then they will not care how devout you have been, but will welcome you based on the virtues you have lived by.

I watched both parents suffer greatly in the last years of their life. One in a nursing home, unable to get out of bed and in so much despair  and pain she begged me to end her life every time I saw her. My father had a stroke and was basically &#39;locked in;&#39; unable to communicate for the last years of his life yet his brain was fine. I have never seen eyes filled with fear like his were. If we had a dog that could not move, feed itself or move anything apart from its eyes, we would be prosecuted for keeping it alive yet we do it to our beloved humans. It is a sick society that allows this to happen just because a tiny minority think it is god&#39;s will when most people have the sense not to believe in such things. It is unbearably sad that people have to take their own life in such terrible ways because nobody in power has the sense or compassion to do what is right and allow euthanasia and assisted suicide to those who want and need it."

God is good because He gives His blessings to everyone, whether they be good or bad. but everyone has at least, told a lie, or stolen something in their life. and that makes them sinners, and God will not allow sinners in heaven; in His presence, because He is holy. so, God has to punish the sinners in hell, because God is severe and just. but God is also love and He made a way for some to be saved from His wrath. here are the steps: <br>1. admit that you&#39;re a sinner and are lost. <br>2. realize that the penalty of sin is death (hell). <br>3. believe that Jesus (who is God) died on the cross, was buried, then rose from the grave, to pay the penalty for man&#39;s past, present, and future sins. <br>4. trust Christ alone as your Savior, and not on your own good deeds to get you to heaven (nor a combination of your faith and self-righteous works).<br>5. pray to God NOW that you&#39;re accepting Christ&#39;s free gift of salvation because if you die before making this decision, it&#39;s too late, and you&#39;ll üî•ü•µüòà<br>6. and to be a disciple, tell people about Jesus, read the bible, go to church regularly to know God&#39;s will for your life."

If I was worrying about an upcoming job interview, then maybe this anxiety would help me to make sure that I am properly prepared - lay my clothes out the night before to make sure that nothing needs to be ironed or washed, go to the interview location a day or so before to insure I know exactly where I need to go so I don‚Äôt get lost and be late, research the company ahead of time so I can make informed answers to the interviewer‚Äôs questions, etc.         <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Tm6Z1y3h94&amp;t=158"">2:38</a>"

This verse is arguably the most precise Gospel presentation in all of Scripture:¬†it leads us to understand our sinful nature, while promising eternal life in Christ.<br><br>‚ÄúBe anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God; and the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus‚Äù (Philippians 6-7, NKJV).<br><br>Matthew 6<br>Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?<br>[26] Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?<br>[27] Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?<br>[28] And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:<br>[29] And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.<br>[30] Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?<br>[31] Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?<br>[32] (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.<br>[33] But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.<br>[34] Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof."

@joeysplats3209,2023-03-26T20:22:24Z,2023-03-26T20:22:24Z,1,"Between now and the time you die, you should consider it important to be important to others.  The simplicity of a genuine compliment, for example.  Try it: Find something about someone you know, or a complete stranger, and compliment them about it.  It must be sincere, or it is not a true compliment.  Smile at strangers.  When you get to the checkout clerk, look at the name tag, smile, look them in the eyes and say &quot;Hi David&quot; or whatever their name is, of course. David says the same thing to everyone and everyone says the same thing to him.  A kind word or compliment is priceless."

@Chichichiaaa,2023-03-18T00:33:01Z,2023-03-18T00:33:01Z,0,"I wait with great hope for the day I never have to wake again, but before you panic thinking oh the poor soul is suicidal, know that I am not. I simply am tired of the ugliness that is all around the world. People pretend to care about others but in reality, nobody really ever cares about anyone other than themselves and their belongings. The ugly is everywhere you look and people don&#39;t even try to hide it anymore. I look forward to the day when I am never again bothered by the stress of how terrible humanity has become or how little love there is for others. Even the people who claim that all they want is to be loved have ugliness inside of them for the moment you show that you do not agree with them 100% they will attack you and try to cause you harm all the while telling everyone else that you are the aggressor. I long for the days of change and peace though I know I will only find that after my last sleep. Be kind people always and remember that in the end, we all are nothing more than dust that will be forgotten."

@riolop1972,2023-03-15T18:35:43Z,2023-03-15T18:35:43Z,0,Sadly I feel like an NPC these days while it&#39;s seen as a meme the meaning behind it is pretty scary. Like if life is passing right through and around me like I&#39;m an outcast often not acknowledged whatsoever. It&#39;s like I don&#39;t know how to be a human anymore. I miss feeling like my own self as if it were meaningful with simpler ideas of life. I feel I had a better perception of life as a child than I do now as an adult. Whether that&#39;s childish or not I do not know. No pun intended

@noahpearce5759,2023-03-03T09:05:35Z,2023-03-03T09:05:35Z,0,I moved 2 hours away for a girl.  I lived in an apartment near her and got a new job(she lived at home with her parents still while she finished college)before I met her she had bought a house and started to remodel it.  Eventually my lease ran out and I needed a place to stay.  So we planned to finish remodeling the house quick as possible.  The plan was for me to move in and pay the bills to take some stress off of her while she was in college.  Eventually the house was done and I moved in.  She was almost done with college and would be moving in with me soon.  She decided to leave me :((( and basically drop all contact with me.  Now I am completely alone 2 hours from where I grew up and I don‚Äôt have much family nor any friends.  All I‚Äôve know the last 2 years were her and her friends/family.  My family basically disowned me and didn‚Äôt support me at all in those 2 years.  I reached out to them recently and let them know what happened.  They‚Äôre willing to help me but I‚Äôm not sure if I wanna move back home.  I feel like I‚Äôll be back to square one.  I‚Äôm driving my self insane trying to decide where to go and what job I will get.  Plz pray for meüò¢

The Lord has given us our life which is enough time to decide if you accept him and his son who died on a cross for your sins. It should only take 20 seconds to say yes I love you and accept you.But he gives us 80 years With beautiful surroundings to make it easier to decide. It&#39;s all about what&#39;s going on inside of yourself not what&#39;s going on in space that means nothing. I hope you make your decision cause you could die tonight.

@og4372,2023-02-14T18:07:19Z,2023-02-14T18:07:19Z,0,"I can only imagine the knee jerk reaction of those who can&#39;t accept the idea that when your brain ceases to function that it is lights out.  I find it more self serving and much more narcissistic to believe you will persist after your body has stopped functioning and your brain died.  After all, we are already the main actors in our own lives.  <br><br>Why must one command the attention of eternity based on writings in myths?  No myth, even ones you don&#39;t consider myth, have any proof beyond mere speculation.  The closest we can come is near death, which could mean you did die with little or no brain damage.  The point to heed here is those experiences are deeply colored by our own biases, which affects how we interpret the experience.  Those who reject the lights out theory of death generate quite the negative response as one rejects their indoctrination.  <br><br>While there are many who understand the difference in an object lost has to be somewhere and death is permanent, some are led to believe our being is somehow different from that object permanence point of view.  Those who reject sensible conclusions can&#39;t accept a peaceful state of mind, that in the end, we are gone.  The difference is knowledge your brain determines who you are and that a soul is just another myth.  What is comforting is you can decide to be your own person vs. living up to some immoral view of the world from a book containing insane myths which are typically contradictory to what we actually know to be true.  As evidence of this difference, somehow on this subject I mentioned death is lights out casually.  The response from a believer was nearly violent &quot;THAT IS NOT WHAT I BELIEVE!&quot;.  The hate produced by such conviction truly tested his world view.  It builds this expectation you will see someone again, comforting I guess, but very counter productive for grief.  Acceptance is the only true way, and I am not talking about accepting myths but reality.  Acceptance of reality is the best tool we have to adapt and prepare for what is to come.  The cheapest swindle of man kind is to have that expectation of eternal life, after all, who will be back to confirm or deny it once those lights have gone out with any provable metrics or actual evidence such has occurred?"

A trivial one you might say when I describe it, nothing of any value to anybody else. My epiphany was &#39;&#39;why do I always wear black?&#39;&#39;. I&#39;ve been doing it since age 14 and it&#39;s brought me no pleasure, just grief from trying to appear tidy (no hairs, dandruff, dust marks etc). So I asked myself, which character out of my favourite movies has the best look? My answer was Brett (played by Harry Dean Stanton RIP) in Alien. As a Science Fiction fan future-grunge suited me fine. Any misgivings I had were immediately dispensed with. After all, how long did I have left? I wanted to express myself (by proxy, sure). After 2 years my wife and close relatives don&#39;t even ask anymore, they just put it down to senility üôÇ.<br>Along with this I&#39;ve changed my attitude on health or lack of it. My doctor says I drink too much. My liver is shot. I suffer from Grand Mal photosensitive epilepsy so the next seizure might be my last.

For some stupid reason, everyone will be held accountable for their mistakes, and others will be rewarded for their patience. Some stupid people lived a full life and died, knowing in the end that Muslims are right. Most foreigners spend their lives trying to make freedom enter everything. They have unlimited sex until it makes them hate the opposite sex and want Experiencing sex with the same sex and then justifying it with stupid genes that correct scientific articles always confirm that those genes that homosexuals claim exist are not true.Regardless of the fact that it is an innate act, and all monotheistic religions prohibit it, cohabitation and other actions, I heard one of these people say that in the end he does not bear the costs of marriage and that cohabitation is better if you really are. We are. Love each other as you say, you were going to marry again, so why should a girl make herself a commodity and get married, she does not like the feeling when she is someone&#39;s property and her lover does not feel ashamed and cuckold when he knows that about her previous relationship and that she slept with a man before him regardless that Christianity forbids adultery and eating Pork and see for yourself. If you are a Christian who does not practice your religion, you live your whole life disorganized like children. What is the point of wasting your life in vain and claiming to be a Christian? And atheists are stupid too. Think logically with me. You are an atheist. Isn&#39;t that the case if you touch somethingwill move. You are the reason for it. This means that we humans have a reason and there is no reason in this life without a reason. This goes against the laws of physics according to Newton&#39;s first law. The principle of inertia. Check it out for yourself. I wrote an article here. I will not go on to explain here anyway in Christianity also how there can be three gods at the same time, the Father, the Holy Spirit and Jesus. No matter how good they are, they will differ in some things, leaving you confused and confused by their difference as well. So it makes sense that there is only one God. Would another mother come to share with your mother in your upbringing and offer you her ideas, and what if she is bad, you are young and you do not realize that, then you will become confused between your first and second mother, so it is better to have one mother"

To imply that Hitler, for example, did ‚Äònothing‚Äô, merely because he died, is obviously absurd. So why should we say this about anyone else? Everything everyone does has an indirect impact on the sequence of civilization itself regardless of talent or status. The idea that human beings will ‚Äòvanish into the abyss of nothingness‚Äô and that ‚Äònothing they do will matter anyway‚Äô gives them no reason to aspire toward the good. No one has ever been able to prove such claims. So if you‚Äôre going to speak hypothetically, at least give people a substantial reason to be better human beings. That, or retitle the video."

Aries failure was called that because this experiment proved the Earth was stationary.  Then Hubble proved that everything was moving away from us putting us at the centre of creation.  So after a few meetings and some creative spin they came up with the &quot;Baloon&quot; story saying that wherever you are everything looks like it&#39;s moving away like dots on a balloon,  The trouble was the math didn&#39;t work with this piece of spin so after another series of meetings they came up with Dark matter.  And used circular reasoning to prove it exists.  The maths proves it exists. because the math doesn&#39;t work with out it.  Even though if you just say &quot;we are in the middle&quot; you no longer need it to exist.  I have simplified it a bit but the truth is.  We hold a favoured position in the universe because God put us here.  Earth is not an insignificant spec and you have the spark that was given to you by a God who adores you and wants you to wake up to the lies by those evil people who have sent millions of our children into wars so they can profit.  There is no evolutionary reason why a father would die to save a child or a mother would starve to save another one.  These are qualities science fails to explain but knowing the truth it makes perfect sense.  Trust the science?  No thank you."

@Shannon77785,2023-01-14T08:09:24Z,2023-01-14T08:09:24Z,0,Your life on earth does matter. You are alive for a reason. What you do and what you say matters. How you live your life matters. The creator of the universe created each one of you. God is real. Jesus Christ is real. Heaven is real. The spirit world is real. Give your heart to God and to his Son Jesus Christ. Repent (turn away) from your sins. Believe in Jesus Christ and the Father in heaven and ask him into your heart. Give your life to him today before it&#39;s too late. Tomorrow is not promised. You can live forever with him in eternity. He can give you his peace and hope for now and the future. There is meaning to this life because of Jesus Christ. He died on the cross to pay the penalty for our sins so that we could belong to him and live with him forever to rule and reign with him on earth. We are living in the &quot;end times.&quot; Jesus is going to return one day. Be ready for his return. Jesus can save you if you ask him to. You don&#39;t want to be left behind to go through the &quot;Great Tribulation&quot; which will happen on this earth. The Father in heaven loves you. Jesus loves you. You have everything to gain by following Jesus Christ. &quot;For God so loved the world that He gave his one and only begotten Son that whoever believes in him will not perish but will have everlasting life.&quot; John 3:16 üòá‚úùüôè

It doesn&#39;t matter how unsuccessful or prosperous one is in this life, eventually it will not matter. No matter how many times and how forcefully someone shoves their success in your face eventually they will not matter, to anyone! Eventually everything one did will no long matter so some might say what is the point of life, which is one of the biggest questions we ask others and ourselves all the time. There&#39;s a point to everything in nature. Take the wolves away and we would have desert, take bees away and flowers wouldn&#39;t prosper, if the wind didn&#39;t blow corn wouldn&#39;t grow, there&#39;s a system and reason for everything! I don&#39;t think our lives are any different. There&#39;s a reason we are here and alive (conscious). To live and just die? What&#39;s the purpose? Our &#39;highly advanced&#39; modern science has been trying to answer what many call the hardest scientific question and quest. What is consciousness. Science has conducted experiments showing that something leaves the body at &#39;death&#39;. No one is going to tell me that there&#39;s nothing after death because I know better. I&#39;ve had to many paranormal experiences and a medium who knew things that, there&#39;s no way he could have. To live and just die? Makes no sense. Death is the beginning of a new beginning."

It will either be an amazing adventure or a beautiful sleep, as it was before I was born."

@sigurdthedragonslayer1810,2022-12-19T22:45:07Z,2022-12-19T22:45:31Z,1,I don&#39;t understand how is it am i supposed to live if I have no purpose in life and let&#39;s if my purpose is to help people and impact their life in a good way still they going to move on too and die  so there must be a greater purpose for us to exist other than absurd coincidence. This is just depressing to think about even if  am rich and powerful and have every thing  at my disposal  all the joys  and pleasures in the world if u do it u will get used to  it and  get bored  eventually ur  dopamine will be exhausted. And then there&#39;s nothing else for u to do but die . I believe our existence  is intended for greater purpose look to our bodies and the biology of the the human beings  it is just magnificent look to the universe and space and earth and every thing and question ur self is this really a coincidence or we are meant to be here.  I think if there&#39;s nothing after death then there is no point for us to stay alive and experience life suffering and sorrows. Or life pleasures and happiness because in the end u will fade away into nothingness. So my belief is that we are here for a purpose and it is not to help people and to be kind and passionate and considered of others. I thinks its greater and to be kind and thoughtful is just  small part of that purpose.

My dad was an Air Force B-52 pilot, so we moved about every two years and sometimes more often.  I attended 5 different High Schools and was lucky to have a C average and be accepted to college.  In 1967 when the Vietnam War was in full swing and people were being drafted, I joined the Marine Corps to avoid being drafted into the Army.  When they send me to Vietnam, I wanted to be with the best.  My first full time job out of college was as a Marine platoon commander in Vietnam.  Hard year.  Lots of death, destruction, wounded, and chaos.  <br><br>I served in the Marines as an infantry officer for 21 years with a total of 3 years in combat.  I was at the evacuation of Saigon in April 1975.  I commanded 5 platoons and 3 companies.  I served 2 years in a Latin American country in the middle of a serious civil war collecting intelligence and supporting counter-insurgency operations with the host nation&#39;s Army and Navy.  I was tasked to automate the Marine Corps&#39; Officer Assignment Process that took 3 years to accomplish.  I was an instructor.  I served a tour with the US Special Operations Command conducting strategic analyses in Latin American countries with 3 Army area specialists officers.  I retired from the Marines in 1989.<br><br>I worked 7 years as a Division Manager providing strategic analyses for US Special Operations Command and 3 years working with another company developing new technologies for Special Operations.  I then became an independent consultant supporting Department of Defense high technology programs mostly for Special Operations but also for the Army and Navy.  Those jobs required be to trave around the world many times over teaching military units how to use new technologies and supporting military exercises with technical support for those technologies.  Again, mostly with Special Operations.  Those military exercises were usually in unpleasant locations in primative conditions.  I permanently retired on Dec 31, 2015.<br><br>I&#39;m a 3D computer graphics artist, and in my life I I put 60,000 miles on motorcycles, I became a private pilot with instrument and commercial ratings, glider pilot, SCUBA diver and underwater photographer, sailing sail boats, whitewater canoeing, rock climbing, played Delta Blues guitar, sky diver, x-country skier, expert with pistol and rifle, and the normal camping, hiking, etc.<br><br>I&#39;ve had an interesting life.  I&#39;ve enjoyed my time here on earth even though there were some very hard times / challenges to overcome.  I&#39;m at peace with myself and I do not fear death.<br><br>So, what&#39;s my point?  The video is wrong.  Your consciousness  (AKA Soul) survives death and returns to where you came from originally that most people call Heaven.<br><br>20 years ago I became interested in Near Death Experiences (NDE) after reading Dr Raymond Moody&#39;s book &quot;Life After Life&quot; which detailed many of the experiences of people who were clinically dead for some period of time and were revived and told of their experiences of leaving their bodies and going to Heaven for some period of time and then returning to their bodies after being revived.  In those 20 years, I&#39;ve studied thousands of NDE experiences.  The evidence is overwhelming that your soul becomes you at the moment of conception and remains with you until you die.<br><br>An interesting aspect of NDEs is that no two are exactly alike, but the majority of them have similar characteristics.<br><br>Many of you (probably most) will reject that idea, but if you have an open mind, do an internet search for NDE and watch the testimonies of those who experienced death and the transition from body to pure consciousness in Heaven and then returned to their bodies after being told &quot;It&#39;s not your time&quot;.<br><br>And it turns out that you don&#39;t live just once.  Souls sometimes return to earth as another person.  Sometimes it is very soon after death and sometimes it is centuries after death.  The University of Virginia has a Department dedicated to researching thousands of cases of reincarnation.  Perhaps one of the best documented cases can be found here: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6B27WRX0Auw"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6B27WRX0Auw</a>.   If you would like more &quot;proof&quot; then do and internet search for &quot;Ghost in my Child&quot; with parents relating their children telling them about their past lives and past parents.  Fascinating.<br><br>So why do souls come / return to earth?  The answer lies in what the NDE survivors relate what they are told while in heaven.  It varies, but if you think of earth as a university, it&#39;s where souls come to gain knowledge and grow in spirituality before returning &quot;home&quot; to Heaven and your body is like a suit of clothes your soul wears while on earth.  Eventually that suit is destroyed or simply wears out and we who remain on earth perceive that as death, but the soul is eternal.<br><br>If you are honest and open minded, I think the references I&#39;ve given you will at least give you pause to think and perhaps pursue more on your own to find the answers."

Your paradigm shifts once time begins to fly. I guess all we can do is fly with it and soar toward what we aspire to in life. Somehow, I can&#39;t help but be deeply unsatisfied at knowing everything I do will be forgotten and erased. But maybe it&#39;s what we do when we do it that matters? As opposed to the legacy of what we do? In other words, the moments of life matter when we are in those moments. And maybe that can be good enough because we won&#39;t be here when those moments pass. Mental health issues, money stress, and a lack of free time sure don&#39;t help. But I&#39;m hoping I can work forward to the point of being able to enjoy life more."

We can make or break someones day - heck many peoples day.  We can make the lives of people better or make them absolutely miserable.   Those aren&#39;t tiny things and if we are the best version of ourselves we can make a big positive impact on peoples lives.  And if we become the worst most miserable version of ourselves we will bring other people into that hell.   This analogy of being so small appealed to me at one point but now I like the idea of how meaningful our lives are.

Such a mighty creator who humbles us with his very creations and by giving us a conciense to articulate the world around us. A rock cannot articulate what is around it. It is matter alone. It does not have spirit. Humans and animals  are unique because we have spirit. But God creates his beings similar and very different. We live on the same earth, so various lifeforms will have similar qualities in some areas, but God is creative nonetheless and Earth is only a small miniscule fraction of Gods vast creativity and wisdom. Truly incredible. God made us so small and yet he loves us that he died for us in human form so our wrongdoings can be pardoned. So incredible and loving God is. When we realize how small God has created us, we realize how much less  trivial wordly things do not matter. What matters is spirit. Of course, wordly things have purpose but most things that do not reflect the spirit do not matter at all."

Why is death disease and suffering something we all hate? <br> The answer to both of these questions is because we were created to be loved and love others. The reason we so earnestly  desire lasting relationships is because that is the very thing we were designed to enjoy! <br>  In a world that tells you your meaningless, just remember that the Creator would tell you otherwise.

@donnietobasco9791,2022-10-25T11:42:31Z,2022-10-25T11:44:26Z,0,"This is a VERY useful video for supporting the assertion (as Voltaire did) that &quot;even if god didn&#39;t exist....it would be necessary to invent him..&quot; What I mean by this is that.....the raw, true comprehension of what we are, where we are and just how little meaning or consequence our individual lives have within the broader picture.... kind of lends itself to our human &quot;need&quot; to try and give our lives a much greater and much more worthy frame of reference than all the observable evidence suggests.<br><br>It might even be further argued that this &quot;impulse&quot; may well have been deliberately leveraged upon us.<br><br>The Gnostics (for example) viewed humanity as an &quot;illegal&quot; creation. The work of a vain, egotistical demigod who took it upon himself to imprison spirits within corporeal bodies and totally isolate them from any true knowledge or awareness of their origins. The net result? Well...(as the assertion goes)...the net result is basically a self-aware species who have basically been forced to try and reach out and reconnect themselves with their true, spiritual heritage.<br><br>The &quot;demigod&quot; (we&#39;re told)...KNEW full well that this human outreach would eventually occur, and decided to pose as humanity&#39;s spiritual creator or parent. Humanity&#39;s choice would be either hopeless nihilism, anxiety and despair....OR....they could opt to worship the &quot;demigod&quot; who would at least provide these human/spirits &quot;some&quot; of the truth and meaning they&#39;d been separated from and were now desperately seeking.<br><br>The &quot;demigod&quot; has many names and incarnations. Yaldabaoth (for example)....although most modern folk now know him as Yahweh, Jehovah or Allah. He is the force behind the eastern, desert religions and now has both The Bible and the Quran deeply embedded within the human psyche as being the ONLY genuine &quot;go to&quot; references for any human beings who wish to enjoy spiritual communion with (what they mistakenly believe to be)....their creator. <br><br>As one might imagine however, these convoluted, antiquated narratives would not &quot;ring true&quot; or feel spiritually congruent with many human beings and instead, they would resist any personal investiture upon these narratives....most notably....in the form of atheism.<br><br>Atheism (it&#39;s argued) actually brings a human being CLOSER to spiritual truth, even though most atheists likely wouldn&#39;t thank anybody for that particular compliment. Atheism also however....takes the &quot;demigod&#39;s&quot; (deceived) worshippers BACK to the notion of hopeless nihilism, anxiety and despair....which is why atheism is so scorned, feared and resisted by the demigod&#39;s totally duped &quot;worshippers.&quot;<br><br>Remember how the demigod originally framed human existence?<br><br>Well that still holds up. <br><br>You either worship the demigod....OR.....you&#39;re condemned to a life without hope, meaning or purpose.<br><br>If human atheism was something that took humanity AWAY from divine truth, then it would likely deserve all the hate it gets from believers. But because of the world we live upon and because of whose &quot;creation&quot; this really is, ....human atheism is actually a resistant, disbelieving &quot;virtue&quot;....in this instance.<br><br>It&#39;s the mark of a person who doesn&#39;t for one moment claim to know EVERYTHING......but who certainly knows &quot;enough&quot; about the demigod&#39;s ridiculous claims and narratives....to utterly reject them on both rational and ethical grounds.<br><br>It&#39;s an interesting concept is it not?<br><br>I&#39;ve obviously fleshed it out a bit......but it would make a fantastic TV drama I think.<br><br>If I remember rightly, the book &quot;His Dark Materials&quot; by Phillip Pullman is a Gnostically inspired, as is The Matrix etc....<br><br>Lots to ponder!!"

Of course it worked out in the end as it always does when I give it to God. However, not entirely being in control of the outcome of whatever it may be is difficult. The reason why I‚Äôm posting this is because when I watched this video it actually made me quite sad at first until I realize that life as we know it may end but then lies the beauty of Gods promise. So this message is to anyone that looked at this video and possibly became stressed, sad, depressed etc that God has a different ending; give him a chance on a very personal level - just you and him.

This would be a logical, factual ideology IF God had not &quot;loved the world into being&quot;, &quot;loved the world so much, He sent His Only Son so that we might have life, eternal life&quot; in paradise. God&#39;s arrival to this rock was for a distinct, divine purpose. He wanted all human beings, made in His likeness, to know Him and experience the endless joy only found in Him. Otherwise, your depressing, hopeless, despairing prediction would have come true. Luckily, God loves us more than that. He loves us so much, He sacrificed Himself, His only begotten Son, so that we might share in the Kingdom of Heaven for eternity. No human being could have done that for us. The Saints show us how to live a life of purpose and faith. The only tragedy is not becoming a Saint. We are all known from the beginning, every hair on the head of every person, ever. He knew us from the beginning. We were made for joy in God alone. &quot;Our hearts will not rest until they rest in Thee&quot;. Don&#39;t believe the hopeless nihilism in this awful, trite, uneducated video garbage. There is more...much more and it&#39;s better than anyone can fathom. &quot;No eye has ever seen, no ear has ever heard, nor mind ever imagined the glorious things God¬†has¬†prepared for those who love him.‚Äù Our human purpose is to love God, love neighbor and to have Faith, Hope &amp; Charity. God bless you, friends."

@davidmatthews6624,2022-08-02T14:12:13Z,2022-08-02T14:14:04Z,1,"Kind of cool. What you said is basically the same thing King Solomon said in Ecclesiastes in the Bible some 3000 years ago. Except he said it because he left one Thing out. Doesn&#39;t it seem rather odd that we could be on a rock with consciousness and ability to ponder life and understand the concept of purpose and conclude we don&#39;t have one?  To say we are amazingly born, living on a planet that somehow allows us to have joy and love and experience but then say such an incedible existence means nothing in the end is like saying 1 million times 1 billion = 0. I&#39;m not sure that is good mathematics.  It&#39;s a great video, and I will share it with others, but a reasonable analysis of the mathematics should lead us another direction : to realize that such an amazing existence means we must have a purpose beyond what we can see. You are so right. if all you said is true, we have no purpose, the video is meaningless, and all our problems are nothing. Yet maybe the video, like Ecclesiastes 1, is leaving something- Somone - out of the equation. Try, just for fun, to just pretend God exists. You dont have to believe it, but just do the mathematics factoring a Creator in, and see if the equation suddenly doesn&#39;t equal zero anymore. Thanks for a great Ecclesiastes video!"

Wow so vast so far away we would have to live for ever in order to explore it all right. Well that is exactly what Jehovah will do with the people who obey him in the near future. This life is short, why not invest it Jehovah God‚Äôs kingdom. He promises you will live a great life now and in the new system of things everlasting life, in this new system you will be able to have good health, lots of good friends, and free to explore anything for ever."

I know a lot of you will think that I don‚Äôt know anything and am holding on to hope and false beliefs, or you may even misunderstand who I am and what the community I‚Äôm part of is, but I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, aka, ‚ÄúMormons‚Äù. A lot of you may see Mormons and automatically assume from the false information spread around about us that we are bad, confused, or similar to flat earthers in a way. Actually, we are quickly spreading around the whole globe, with more members than ever before, as more and more take the time to understand and realize what this church is. Basically, we are Christian but have the rest of the truth from Christs original church restored to us after it was lost long ago. We believe and a lot of us say we know that God is there, the second coming of Christ WILL happen soon before the end of the world, and that there is much more after our life here on earth, a whole eternity ahead of us after death. If you have more questions, I strongly recommend reading the Book of Mormon as it DOES answer questions, and also just reading about the LDS church on our website (which you can find by searching up LDS). I am not trying to start any arguments or prove anyone wrong on what they believe, but just sharing what I and many many others know and believe to be true. Thanks for reading, I hope you learned or were reminded of something good from reading this, and I testify that God does exist, he loves you, and knows you."

The first effect is this video makes people feel better, they become calm.  However, the second effect is it makes people become worst, they become more anxious.<br><br> I believe that the people who have a good psychological effect on because they understand that this video is talking about the truth and these group of these people are willing to accept the truth. However, the second group, they don&#39;t care about that is true or not because their mind is sticking on what they used to belief.<br><br>This reminds me that one time one guy came to tell me that don&#39;t learn science too much, if you learn science too much you will forget God.

If I believe in the truth, it makes myself to be strong and confident and this video is talking about the truth so after watching the the video it makes me pappy and feel release. <br>I don&#39;t want to put myself on the belief because I might  believe in wrong things.

@pressurecooker2100,2022-07-26T09:11:08Z,2022-07-26T09:11:08Z,0,Only practical people will find this calming.... the point of saying that nothing really matters on a universal scale... is that there is no sense in wasting even a second of your already tiny existence on hurting/fearing and the only thing that you should practically do is to be grateful for this experience of however tiny existence you get and to touch as many lives as possible in a positive way.

I know. Millions of people know. Who created this miraculous wonder universe and created us can end it and can recreate everything again as he promised in all the holy books and told through all the prophets he send. He didn&#39;t create this for nothing he didn&#39;t leave us stray. We are important and everything we do matter to us. He never asked you great results or expectations as everyone else. <br>He only wants you to do what you can and keep you heart innocent spread love especially to your beloved family and you must know he&#39;s there never left us and he sent all the messages we need to  take our hands to peace in this world and heaven in after life. <br>Not believing in  him in Allah and in after  life doesn&#39;t mean he is not there and we will not die and recreate again .it&#39;s only denial to the most obvious true. <br>I&#39;m Muslim  I&#39;m worthy everything I do matters and counted I hope it&#39;s acceptable and multiple rewarded and hope my sins be forgiven by Allah my creator the creator of what we know and what we don&#39;t know. He is the most merciful and most compassionate. Infinity in heaven is the worthy life and his glorious face is the joy beyond all joys.

Here are some verses:<br><br>&quot; I sought the LORD, and He heard me, and delivered me from all my fears&quot; Psalms 34:4<br><br>&quot; I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me&quot; Philippians 4:13<br><br>1 Peter 5:7 says ‚ÄúCast all your anxiety on him because he cares for us‚Äù. Just throw it on him, and let him carry your burdens. Jesus said we could cast all of our cares on him because he cares for us! There is nothing we are going through that we cannot cast on the Lord.<br><br>We shouldn&#39;t worry because we have an amazing God who looks after us and takes care of us. Nothing is too big for our God!  God is so mighty and is all powerful and knowing, God in control and is a awesome, loving, wonderful, beautiful, compassionate, merciful, gentle, forgiving, gracious, sweet. HOLY,. There is so many more verses about how wonderful God is! <br><br>God made us for his pleasure! <br><br>Isaiah 43:7 - Even every one that is called by my name: for I have created him for my glory, I have formed him; yea, I have made him.<br><br>Genesis 1:26 - And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.<br><br>Ephesians 3:9-10 - And to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ:<br><br>there are more verses! God has a plan and purpose for us:<br><br>‚Äú&#39;For I know the plans I have for you,&#39; declares the Lord, &#39;plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you a hope and a future. &#39;‚Äù ‚Äî Jeremiah 29:11<br><br>The Lord loves each and everyone one of you! He died on the cross and shed his blood for you and my sins! He rose again 3 days later (John 3:16) <br><br>Romans 6:23 says &quot; for the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.&quot;<br><br>Friends, We are all sinners and need Gods mercy and grace and his forgiveness. (&quot; for everyone has sinned; we all fall short of God&#39;s glorious standard&quot; Romans 3:23)<br><br>We live in a sin filled fallen world and I believe we are in the end times and The Lord is returning soon. He can come at any moment. <br><br>There is Hope and that is Found in the Lord Jesus Christ! Put your faith in him! He is the one and only way to Heaven and it is what He did for us on the cross. Not by anything that we could ever do or have done. You can&#39;t be good enough or earn your way to Heaven, it is through Jesus and only Jesus!!!<br><br>Romans 10:9 says, &quot; if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved&quot; <br><br>Romans 10:13 says, &quot; Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved&quot; <br><br>If you ask God for forgiveness HE will forgive you!<br>&quot; But if we confess our sins to him,he is faithful and just to forgive us and cleanse us from all wickedness.&quot; 1 John 1:9<br><br>I pray that you all will come to the Lord and place your faith in him. Ask him into your heart and be your Lord and saviour and forgiveness for your sins! God is so amazing and his love is unfailing. His mercies renew everyday and he pours out his grace! <br><br>And it doesn&#39;t matter what you are going through God can get you through it! God is mighty and powerful  and in control. He will heal you and provide for you! He loves you so so much and you are important to him. he cares so much about you. <br><br>There is so much More to know about him and I&#39;m still learning too. The Bible ( his word) has so much in it and I hope you will read it, It explains so much about what is going on and what is going to happen.  as well as God&#39;s promises, Love and Hope and the wonderful things He has done! <br><br>I&#39;m sharing this because That is what God wants us to do is to spread the good news to everyone.<br><br>&quot; But how can they call on him to save them unless they believe him? And how can they believe him  if they have never heard about him? And how can they hear about him unless someone tells them? Romans 10: 14-15<br><br>Have a wonderful day. Lord bless &lt;3"

But this video proves there is a God and there is a meaning to life. Perfection cannot come from chaos. The Big bang, which was God saying let there be light, created perfection. Everything&#39;s in harmony with each other. Think about this, where did everything come from? Something can not give what it does not have, so where did the animals and the trees and the fish and the birds and all creepy crawling insects where did they all come from? And since something can not give what it does not have where did humans get this intellect from to contemplate all these things? It didn&#39;t come from animals because they don&#39;t have inside themselves intellect to give to us, our intellect comes from above. All of this came from God and if you don&#39;t acknowledge him on this short little time on this rock you will regret it for eternity."

John 1 1-3 while watching this I can look at this with 2 perspectives. 1 without believing God does  exist in which case  I would not recommend this video to a depressed individual. The 2nd perspective believing a creator who chose to create this absolute beauty and allowed me not only exist but give me the ability to know him and give me life abundantly..Jesus Christ is the answer to all your questions.

Like Maria&#39;s Near Death Experience.  She was a heart-attack patient who, while unconscious, reported drifting out of her body through the ceiling and outside the hospital.  When she did, she saw a tennis show on the hospital&#39;s third-story window ledge.  She said it was a man&#39;s shoe, left-footed, dark blue, with a wear mark over the little toe and a shoelace tucked under the heel.  A nurse later investigated, and sure enough  she eventually found the shoe, exactly as Maria had described it in a place on the roof that no one could see from a window.<br><br>Or maybe Pam Reynolds who underwent a  rarely performed procedure, known as hypothermic cardiac arrest (a.k.a. a &quot;Standstill&quot; operation) to remove a brain aneurysm.  The procedure was performed by Dr. Robert F. Spetzler at the Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix, Arizona.  During this procedure, Reynolds&#39;s body temperature was lowered to 50 ¬∞F, her breathing and heartbeat stopped, and the blood drained from her head. Her eyes were closed with tape and small ear plugs with speakers were placed in her ears. These speakers emitted audible clicks which were used to check the function of the brain stem to ensure that she had a flat EEG‚Äîindicating a non-responsive brain‚Äîbefore the operation proceeded. The operation was a success and Reynolds recovered completely. The total surgery lasted about seven hours.  After she recovered from the surgery, she reported everything that had happened during the surgery with extreme precision as, she said, she was floating over the shoulder of the brain surgeon who performed the operation. <br><br>There are <b>thousands</b> of cases like this where the person was clinically dead and left their body only to come back to their body and report things that there was no way they could have known.  History is replete with cases like this and, now-a-days, they are even more prevalent because we have gotten so much better at resuscitating people who are clinically dead.  The question is, what happens to you -- the spiritual you -- the REAL you after you leave your body?   As Robert Jastrow (an American astronomer and planetary physicist) said, &quot;For the scientist who has lived by his faith in the power of reason, the story ends like a bad dream. He has scaled the mountains of ignorance; he is about to conquer the highest peak; as he pulls himself over the final rock, he is greeted by a band of theologians who have been sitting there for centuries.‚Äù"

Unto us a Son is given, and the government will be upon His shoulder. And His name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. ‚Äú<br>Who is Christ? Who is Jesus?<br>Born of a virgin, Mary.<br>Matthew Chapter 1 verse 20: ‚Äù behold, the angel of the Lord appeared to him (Joseph), in a dream and said, ‚ÄúJoseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for that (Christ) which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.<br>Jesus, the Christ, is God‚Äôs word made into flesh.<br>1 John chapter 5 verse 7: ‚Äù For there are three that bear a record in heaven, The Father, The Word, and the Holy Spirit: and these three are one.‚Äù<br>John chapter 1 verse 1: ‚ÄúIn the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&quot;<br>John chapter 1 verse 14:  &quot; And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.‚Äù<br>John chapter 1 verse 10:  &quot;He was in the world, and the world¬† knew Him not.‚Äù<br>Hebrews chapter 4 verse 12:  &quot;For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.‚Äù<br>How beautiful and awesome is God‚Äôs Word, who is our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, magnificent in all His glory, is He.¬† Amen!<br>John‚Äôs Vision Of Christ Seated On His Throne In Heaven:<br>Revelation chapter 4 verse 2 to 3:  &quot;Immediately, I (John), was in the Spirit, and behold a throne sat in Heaven, and One sat on the throne. And He who sat there was like a jasper and a sardius stone in appearance, and there was a rainbow around the throne, in appearance like an emerald.‚Äù<br><br>Why did Christ Jesus came and sacrificed His precious life for sinners like us?<br>Christ (God‚Äôs Word made into flesh), came because through flesh (Adam‚Äôs flesh) sin entered the world, and then because of sin death entered the whole earth. Through flesh (Jesus Christ‚Äôs flesh), the earth will be saved, sin is destroyed, and the curse of death¬† shall be broken, death and the grave shall be cast into hell.<br>Christ, who is God‚Äôs Word made into flesh, sacrificed His life for us. He was crucified for our sins and transgressions. Christ died, and on the third day He resurrected in the flesh, conquering death and the grave. Now,¬† Christ is seated in Heaven, at the right hand of Power (God). Through Christ‚Äôs sacrifice we gain Salvation through God‚Äôs abundant mercy and grace. We are reconciled and recompensed back to God, through the shed blood of His beloved Son Christ Jesus.<br>John chapter 3 verse 16: &quot;For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him, shall not perish, but have everlasting life.‚Äù<br>Romans chapter 5 verse 8: &quot;But God demonstrates His love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.‚Äù<br><br>Christ came to undo the sin and eternal death brought upon the world through the sin of Adam.<br>Death in Adam, Life In Christ:<br>Romans chapter 5 verse 19: &quot;For as by one man‚Äôs disobedience (Adam), many were made sinners, so also by one Man‚Äôs (Jesus) obedience, many will be made righteous.‚Äù<br>Romans chapter 5 verse 18:  &quot;Therefore, as through one man‚Äôs (Adam‚Äôs) offense judgement came to all men, resulting in condemnation, even through one Man‚Äôs (Christ‚Äôs) righteous act, the free gift came to all men, resulting in the justification of life.‚Äù<br>Romans chapter 5 verse 17:  &quot;For if by the one man‚Äôs offense (Adam‚Äôs offense), death reigned through the one, much more those who receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in the life through the One (Jesus Christ).&quot;<br>Romans chapter 5 verse 12:  &quot;Therefore, just as through one man (Adam) sin entered the world, and death through sin, and thus death spread to all men, because all sinned.‚Äù<br>Romans chapter 5 verse 21: <br>‚ÄúSo that as sin reigned in death, even so grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.‚Äù<br><br>Through Adam, sin and death entered the world, so that is why Christ Jesus came to give life, and give it more abundantly. Yes, Christ came to give eternal life through Salvation. The Salvation of His shed blood, and resurrection. Adam‚Äôs flesh brought sin, death, destruction, and condemnation.<br>1 Corinthians 15 : 21-22, ‚ÄúFor since by man(Adam) came death, by Man(Christ), also came the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ, all shall be made alive.‚Äù<br>Christ‚Äôs sacrifice, the crucifixion¬†of His flesh, brings reconciliation of sins, resurrection, eternal life and salvation.<br><br>Christ is coming back again, not as a sacrificial lamb. He is coming back as a roaring, warring lion, to destroy sin, death, and the grave once and for all.<br>Amen! Halleluyah!<br>Revelation chapter 22 verse 12 to 13: ‚Äù And behold, I come quickly, and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be. I am the Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last. ‚Äú<br>Now do you see friends, why Christ Jesus is so Important for our Salvation? Yes.<br>Now, do you understand why there is only one way to God, and that is only through Christ Jesus? Yes.<br>Christ is Salvation. Christ is our Lord and Saviour. Christ is the only way to God. Christ is the only Mediator between God and men (us humans).<br>God loves us so much, He does not want anyone to perish in hell. God wants all sinners to be saved. That is why He sent His Word to save the world. God‚Äôs Word became flesh, and dwelt among us to save us. Christ is God‚Äôs living Word.<br>Will you accept Christ and be saved? Your eternity depends on it. What happens after death, is what&#39;s  important. Where will you spend eternity?<br>Romans chapter 6 verse 23: ‚Äù¬† For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.‚Äù<br>John Chapter 3 verse 16: ‚Äù For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have everlasting life.‚Äù<br>Salvation is free!<br>Christ already paid the price, all you have to do is receive salvation through acceptance of Jesus Christ, Yeshua Ha Massiach.<br><br>So who is Christ?<br>He is The Word Of God. He is the Son of God. He is God. He is the image of the invisible God. He is the Alpha and Omega. He is the beginning and the end. He is the Great I Am. He is Emmanuel. He is The Christ. He is The Messiah. He is The Creator. He is our Lord and Saviour. He is our Mediator. He is the Lion and the Lamb. He is The Rock not cut out by human hands. He is the Root of David. He is Salvation. He is the way, the truth, and life. He is the promise fulfilled to Abraham.<br>Amen!   I love you Lord!<br><br>God created the heavens and the earth with His spoken Word. Did you know that Jesus is that Word, through which all things were created? Yes.<br>John chapter 14 verse 6: &quot;Jesus said to him, I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.‚Äù<br>Colossians chapter 1 verse 15 to 16:<br>&quot;He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation. For by Him all things were created that are in heaven and that are on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers. All things were created through Him and for Him.‚Äù<br>John chapter 1 verse 1 to 4:<br>&quot;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with¬†God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through Him, and without Him nothing was made that was made. In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.‚Äù<br><br>I hope that you now know and understand Christ better, without any doubts, to the glory of God.¬†Amen!<br>Christ is for all who will receive Him.<br>This is how our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ said we should pray. Matthew chapter 6 verse 9 to 13:<br>‚ÄúOur Father in heaven, Hallowed be Your name, Your kingdom come. Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, As we forgive our debtors. And do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen.‚Äù<br>Now that you understand who Christ is, share Christ with others. Christ is The Good News. What do we do with good news? We share it. Amen!<br><br>Repent of your sins. Sin no more! Be baptized in Jesus Name.<br>Submit to God.<br>Love God with all your heart, mind, body, soul, and spirit. Keep God‚Äôs Commandments.<br>Love one another.<br>Forgive one another.<br>It is written, ‚Äúresist the devil, submit to God, and the devil will flee from you.‚Äù<br>Hate sin with all your heart, mind, body, soul, and spirit.<br><br>Rejoice Our King Is Scheduled To Return<br><br>Revelation 19 verse 13-16, &quot; He was clothed with a robe dipped in blood, and His name is called¬†The Word of God, and the armies in heaven, clothed in fine linen, white and clean, followed Him on white horses. Now out of His mouth goes a sharp sword that with it He should strike the nations, and He Himself will rule them with a rod of iron. He Himself treads the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God. And He has on His robe, and on His thigh a name written:¬†King of Kings And Lord of Lords.&quot;<br>Ride on King Jesus!<br>* feel free to copy this info, and share them with others.

Infact, no one ever should be made big or small for anything, because we equally should do something big or small for humanity, but all in vain when we cannot fight against simple problems. You are only a number, a moving and talking object in the infinite universe, you are a puppet being dragged and moved by strings by the energies of the universe controlling big people.

Let me assure every living soul on this planet: YOU are important. YOU matter. YOUR LIFE , how you live it and who you choose to become MATTERS. This short preparatory state of physical mortality ends one day but your life and existence does NOT end here. We are practicing to live an even better existence later. The more self mastery we gain in this life, the more we can be trusted with in the eternities with our loved ones who&#39;s relationships DO NOT end here. Jesus Christ already ensured this for all who choose to accept it and practice living kind and loving lives, improving little by little so He can make of us someone better who is capable of higher happiness than we can now imagine. I wish everyone could know what I know, and everyone CAN learn this for themselves. It is true. Think of the happiest moments of your life. It was when you felt loved, when you chose to selflessly love. When you shared life with someone you cared about at least as much as yourself. True caring relationships. Sacrificing yourself for someone else. Or you felt happiest in the gratitude you felt when someone sacrificed their own interests for yours. This is because what I said is true. There is pupose for this life and it doesn&#39;t end here. We don&#39;t have to grieve forever when we lose a loved one, not because they are forever gone and it&#39;s better to forget them and move on like this video implies, but because this sepperation is temporary! This Earth (this rock) as well as the Solar System, and Galaxy, and Universe was CREATED for YOU. Small as you are, YOU are bigger and more important than all of it! This perfect balance that supports life is NOT a coincidence. One day we will all see clearly, but for now we show we trust our Eternal Father and can be trusted in return to use the gifts and abilities we now have to love and care for one another. It&#39;s easy and quick to destroy and devastate. Don&#39;t choose that path. It takes time, dedication, and love outside ourselves to create, lift, improve and strengthen. The more we do though, the happier we will be in this life and worlds to come that are greater than we can comprehend. That&#39;s precisely WHY we can&#39;t comprehend the creations we are a part of now. To show us how incomprehensible the capabilities of our Eternal Father has and is going to use for the happiness of His children who are ready for it after this life. There IS a purpose for this life. There&#39;s plenty of time for Eternal progression. We just need to start now and be heading in the right direction seeking divine guidance in this life. He&#39;ll correct our course as necessary to take us to where WE will want to be. Trust HIM! The perfect example of love for all of us. Love life! It truly IS a gift! Show gratitude for that gift by making the most of it. Let&#39;s all try harder to love, care and make a difference for the better. What a wonderful world that will be! And... THAT&#39;S THE POINT!!!"

This is not true.  There is a greater power over us and we have souls. We are worth something to God. God and nature gives us all little clues of whats to come.  For Example. Look at a caterpillar it basically dies and transforms itself into a glorious beautiful butterfly or a ugly nasty nymphs that is reborn into a beautiful dragonfly! Are we not worth so much more than insects? Also look at Love, hope and faith. Follow these  and you will not fail. This earth is being protected. We are like a small piece of meat in the jungle but yet no one is devouring us!! Why is that? Because we are being protected by a greater power. So lets try to do only good and love our friends and family members. Plant that seed of Good and the harvest will be Good. This is just my opinion but i speak from the heart."

@DA-to1ej,2022-07-21T15:22:04Z,2022-07-21T15:22:04Z,0,"This video does not quell anxiety or mitigate stress. It promotes nihilism ( all is meaningless ). It actually creates an unhealthy cognitive dissonance in the person because almost all human beings look to have meaning in their lives. Therefore, its contents are not practical for daily living. No one can live a happy and joyful life under nihilism. <br><br>Yet, human beings do matter. When a person looks into the eyes of their newborn baby or the love of their life, it is not absurd; it is love. And that love serves as the driving force for their purpose: to care for their baby or look after their lifelong love. So already, we see that nihilism is bankrupt. <br><br>Great human beings such as Isaac Newton, Thomas Jefferson, Albert Einstein, and Benjamin Franklin were all deists (God revealed through reason and nature). And I am not advocating for religion or any particular spiritual beliefs. I am saying that nothing of any practical importance has come from nihilism - ever. It has only produced a few philosophers. The most prominent is Nietzsche and we all know how he ended up (mental breakdown, drinking own urine). <br>Ironically enough, the creator of this video would not have the freedom of speech to promote nihilism if it were not for two of the aforementioned men. So, their lives mattered, especially to them. <br><br>There is also the fallacious argument that material size somehow equates with meaningfulness. Hence, a human is incredibly small compared to the earth. And the earth is infinitesimally small compared to the universe. So, the human does not matter. That is ridiculous. The cells in a human&#39;s brain are extremely small compared to the brain itself. And if enough of those perish, well, you get the picture. <br><br>Finally, in philosophical terms:<br>(P) All is meaningless<br>(P) Your life does not matter<br>(C) So try your best, and practice empathy, honesty, compassion, decency, and love<br><br>The critical thinker would ask, why should I? <br><br>It is better to leave stress and anxiety therapy to those who have studied it and are licensed to give sound advice. This kind of stuff is dangerous."

And all your good deeds are rewarded in the next life. And all those tyrants who think they will mot be held accountable will be brought in the day of judgement and they won&#39;t hide anything, they will confess and be punished. Anyone and everyone including animals will get justice. I invite to all non-muslims to the only true religion of the creator to worship him alone."

@getsavedtoday9636,2022-07-20T23:48:04Z,2022-07-20T23:48:04Z,0,"Hello everyone,<br><br>If you were to die today, are you 100% sure that you would go to Heaven? It is simple to get saved and know that you are going to Heaven when you die, so why wait? Please read below:<br><br>I love our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, with all my heart and I want to tell you about him. We are all sinners who have come short of the glory of God. God cannot allow a single sin into Heaven because he is a Holy God. The punishment for sin is Hell, and we are all sinners. God does not want anyone to go to Hell. God loves us so much that he sent his only begotten son to die for our sins. His son, Jesus Christ, took on all of sin when he died on the cross for us. Jesus Christ‚Äôs blood washes away ALL of our sins (past, present. and future). Believe in your heart that God raised Jesus Christ from the dead on the third day. This gift of salvation and eternal life is a free gift of God. By the grace of God, we are saved by faith alone, not of ourselves or our works. <br><br>None of us know when we will die. Having faith in Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior and getting saved allows you to have this gift of eternal life in Heaven. Repent. Put your faith in what Jesus Christ did on the cross to save you. Trust in Jesus Christ to save you. Believe in, trust, and have faith in the Gospel, the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.<br><br>If you are sincere about this, say a prayer to God about it!<br><br>A couple of resources: <br><br>Check out &quot;How to Get Saved&quot; and &quot;The Gospel&quot; by Robert Breaker on YouTube, and check out &quot;How to Get Saved and Be a REAL Bible-Believer&quot; by Gene Kim (REAL Bible Believers) on YouTube.<br><br><br><br>Some verses from the King James Version Bible:<br><br>Romans 3:23<br><br>23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;<br><br><br><br>2 Corinthians 7:10<br><br>10 For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.<br><br><br><br>1 Corinthians 15:1-4<br><br>15 Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;<br><br>2 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.<br><br>3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;<br><br>4 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:<br><br><br>Acts 16:30-31<br><br>30 And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?<br><br>31 And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.<br><br><br>Ephesians 2:8-9<br><br>8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:<br><br>9 Not of works, lest any man should boast.<br><br><br>Please let me know if this message has helped lead you to Jesus Christ and your salvation. Thank you for your time."

All the narrator wants to speak about how &quot;small we are&quot; how can you measure the meaning of your life by the size of some lifeless rocks. You have inside of you the most precious of all gifts in the universe which is consciousness. Something so rare we cannot find it anywhere in this universe, not without trying, but it is glaring obvious that what we have is rare. Our lives and consciousness, so rare, one could say that its almost the reason this universe exists, as without us the 99.9% of dead rock would have no eyes or mind to behold its beauty. So when someone says &quot;you are small you are nothing you are worthless&quot; remember that on the cosmic scale you are actually rare, unique and significant. And your story, even if it only goes on for a short amount of time, every moment of your life will echo in eternity, forever imbedded in the laws of nature."

This guy is in a very depressed, joyless headspace. <br><br>We are all part of something greater. We each have a pivotal role in God‚Äôs grand opera of salvation history. We each were given gifts and a mission. We‚Äôre all invited to live in eternal communion with Christ and each other. Our existence is sweeter than any human on Earth can imagine until passing through the veil at death into eternity, had we chosen to live a good and moral life. <br><br>But even while on this blue pearl called Earth, with love through grace, we can taste that sweetness through the joy of our children, through friends and family, by giving of oneself and serving others, by doing God‚Äôs work, and by recognizing God in His magnificent creation. Life is good. Life matters. <br><br>I get the point of this video, but it‚Äôs drawing a conclusion that is a dark and lonely lie. We are all called to our own version of greatness. Go now, and live joyfully, centered on moral truths, and seek the fullness of truth in His pilgrim Church on Earth, and through science, logic, reason, morality, the human experience‚Äîall of that, yes‚Äîbut all of that is OF God. This physical realm and its quantum laws are mutually inclusive with faith‚Äîthey are born OF God. Every atom, quark, and electron of you is suspended into existence at this very moment by a God who loves without limit. At any point He could cease to think of you and you‚Äôd disappear from this existence‚Äîfrom space and time‚Äîbut He doesn‚Äôt forget you. He holds you in His palm. <br><br>But He is no dictator. He will not force your love upon Himself. You are to choose Him. Snuff out your pride and call for your Father in Heaven‚Äîyour Father who transcends even the stars, the galaxies, even the very fabric of time itself, and know of His love for you. Receive it. And then go out, in your blink of a moment on this Earth and do great things."

That includes the &#39;I&#39; thought which represents your identity and is the root of all other thoughts.

You are literally nothing out there so don&#39;t identify with anything. You are everything and have no beginning and no end.

Why do so many people conclude that this life is meaningless and that we amount to nothing? <br><br>Look up at the stars. Look at the simplest form of life on earth. Consider your own body, how intricate it is. How can all of this fascination amount to meaninglessness? Surely we aren‚Äôt just here by chance and for absolutely no reason. If that‚Äôs the case, why not just off ourselves now and rid the world of our toxic nature as humans? <br><br>There is a simple but beautiful answer to all of these hard questions. And if you open your heart and truly seek, those answers are found in the person and being of Jesus Christ. He came into this dark world to be the only Light. To show us why we were created and for whom we were created for. Nothing about this life is meaningless. The Creator of this vast universe has and always will be, God. Our jobs as lost humans is to turn to Him so that we may be set free from the bondage of sin. Sins such as pain, deceit, immorality and every other kind of evil. Once we do that, videos like this one turn is from fear to sorrow. Not only that, but we become sons and daughters of the living God. Please, I ask, if you have not turned your heart to Christ, do so today. My life completely changed when I came to Him and now I don‚Äôt see the world the same at all. I see it more through His lenses of the Holy Spirit working within me. I pray for you all. May God bless you."

He led a very interesting life. I don‚Äôt want to sit here try to remember everything and just list everything he did, but like I said he was interesting and he he just led an interesting life.  We can leave it at that. There was one thing he said a long time ago that‚Äôs always stuck with me and I think about it often.  I believe he said that everyday he picked a time and worried about things for like 10 minutes. Other than that, he pretty much didn‚Äôt care about anything. His rationale was that 80% of things that could happen to you almost certainly won‚Äôt happen to you and 20% of things that could happen to you, there‚Äôs nothing you can do about them anyway, so why waste your life away worrying?"

I concluded that he was at peace as he made this deeply personal revelation and that he had accepted it all. <br>Older people by and large would choose a merciful or quick death over suffering for a longer period of time.

Everybody does. So why not try to make this short life as we want? You want to pass a very important exam. So try hard, work hard. You can be happy in by passing this exam. You may also be happy in life even you fail. But why do we want to fail? We have short time, why not make it more colorful, more luxurious? What bad is in that? You will die anyway. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you lived a simple life or a luxurious life. Again I&#39;m saying, you may be happy in every condition. But why not be happy in a luxurious condition? Don&#39;t compare yourself with the universe. Your life may not affect the universe but this is your life. You have reasons to be in here. So pray to Almighty Allah and make your life happy by trying hard, working hard. If you were sent to this world just for living, doing nothing and dying, then you would have been immortal. Why do you have short life? Because you have to make it Golden life. Remember two kidneys are better than one. Suppose one kidney is happiness and another is luxury. You&#39;ll live even  you have one. But it is always better to have both. So stop comparing yourself with the universe and your life won&#39;t make any impact to the universe and all those shits. Animals can think like this, but you are Ashraful Makhlukat ( Best living being)."

The only way it can feel it&#39;s existence is through it&#39;s animal body. Only the true consciousness will survive and develop in animals around it but the original animal itself will always die.

What you did when you were alive matters too. Maybe it doesn&#39;t matter to you, or to some people, but it matters because anything you do on the world is a creation of yours, and anything you create in the world makes the world react to it. When you die, you leave a mark, it is either a good one, or a bad one. Some are easily forgotten, but some will never be forgotten. There are men who walked this Earth, which names will live until the end of times, such as Mussa ( Moses ) Issa ( Jesus ) Ibrahim ( Abraham ) and the last prophet Mohamed peace be upon him. Their names will live in the hearts of the humans until there is no human left on earth."

What you do on earth has an eternal impact in the spirit realm. You can remain lost in this darkness that people, who claim to be &quot;intelligent&quot; like this producer, live in. Or you can except the true love and light of Jesus Christ. That decision is the greatest of all. Our Creator is who gives us our meaning. These guys are right...to live on this earth and die without Him is meaningless. One thing is for sure, an intelectual can tell you life is worthless and God doesn&#39;t exist. But sit next to a loved one ( as I have) as they pass from this life into the next...and see if you really believe what they say anymore.  Your soul never dies. Why not spend life after death with Jesus in Heaven? Read John 3:16. Simple Truth. There is one amazing thing I can never get over. You can tell a lie one million different ways, but if you tell the truth about something...there is only ONE way to tell it.<br><br>P.S.

Sin separates us  from God but the holy Lord Jesus forgives us. He gave his sinless life to make a way for us.

This is a philosophy that says you should just try your best because it won&#39;t change anything, so therefore you shouldn&#39;t worry about failing. Why doesn&#39;t it add stress? Well, it does for some people, but realistically this worthlessness is just reality, and we can&#39;t change it.

I have a real fear of the coming abyss void or whatever it is. It started after I had a dream where I died and when I woke I found myself trying to imagine nothing. I found myself nearing panic attacks whenever I do. They&#39;re still pretty much every day.<br><br>But this is the kind of perspective I need. I need to stop worrying about what I can&#39;t control and I can&#39;t control nearly everything so I have hardly anything to worry about.

@OlaSkarding,2022-06-23T20:42:59Z,2022-06-23T20:42:59Z,0,"Everyone needs to hear this! <br><br>If you look at a book, would you think someone made it? Or did it come from no one or nothing? <br>If you think it was made by someone you are correct. Books do not just make themselves, It would be very mentaly unstable for someone to belive that.<br>But if you look at the trees, dogs, birds and rocks all around you, do you think it was made by someone?of course it is. That is the way with all things,¬† when you see a house or a book or a picture, you do not doubt someone made it. When you see there is a creation there must be a creator. If it is that simple why would not everyone belive it? <br>Mabye it is because people do not want to belive in the creator, our God. The reason for this is because he requires moral. We can know this because of our conscience and through the revelation in his word which is The Holy Bible. We deny god because we love what is wrong.<br>God, who is the judge of the universe has a list of commandments, that are called the moral law, which is the 10 commandments. <br>If we go through them one by one<br>We can see what we are guily of.<br>Have you ever lied? That makes you a? <br>Have you ever stolen?<br>Have you ever looked at a person with lust?<br>Jesus said that this makes you an adulterer at heart.<br>Have you ever had sex outside of marrage?<br>Have you ever hated somone?<br>In god eyes that makes you a murderer because his standard is som much higher than ours.<br>If you said yes to any of these you are guilty and deserve punishment.<br>The bible tells us that this is the reason we die. The wages of sin is death. God is paying us in death because of our sins, which is dis obedience to the moral law. So death will one day drag us to the judge of the universe, a holy god. And what shall we do when scripture says all liers the their part in the lake of fire? <br>This is where the good news of the gospel come in. So the bible has two parts the old testament where god said he would defeat death, and the new testament where he showed us how he did it. <br>The way he did it was by sacrificing his only son, Jesus on the cross 2000 years ago. He lived without sin and tok the punishment that was on us all. That way God can legaly let us go free from the judgement because somone else has already paid what we owed. We can be judged not guilty because the law has already been satisfied through Jesus.<br>Just like if you were in a court of law and had a stack of speeding fines and a stranger paid those fines, the judge can legally let you go without you having to pay anything.<br>So what you have to do to be saved is repent from sin and belive and trust in Jesus alone. For so god loved the world that he gave his only begotten son, so everyone who belives in him shall not perish, but have everlasting life. We do not automatically become saved even though Jesus has died on the cross.<br>We have a choice to accept the sacrifice of Jesus through faith in him or not belive in him and get judgement by God.<br>Jesus said I am the truth the life and the way, no one comes to the father exept through me. <br>Jesus is the only way cause he is the only one who can forgive our sins.<br>All other religions have what is called works righteousness, where you can earn everlasting life. But the bible tells us that we can not do anything to earn salvation. They also¬† miss the forgivness of sins. <br>Therefor we can know that the god of the bible is the true god. <br>It says in scripture: For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God‚Äînot by works,¬†so that no one can boast. <br><br>If you are reading this I plead with you today to accept Jesus as your lord and saviour. Do it now while you can, you may not have tomorrow.<br>To you reading this, please think through what you have read.<br>And God bless you!"

@limitisillusion7,2022-06-20T19:06:30Z,2022-06-20T19:06:30Z,0,"Significance is not a function of size. This is an illusion built by false perception. Your actions, predetermined or not, will have an eternal effect on the universe. Long after the earth is gone, the carbon atoms in your body will scatter and may even create life on a new planet far away from here. In fact, you&#39;ve likely already created life with carbon atoms shed from your body on this planet. Whether it was a child of your own or a single-celled organism is merely the difference between procreation and creation. Your ego has created an illusion of separation and oddly enough, it&#39;s convinced you that you&#39;re insignificant. To the contrary, the universe is one. Your ability to consciously experience this universe serves as proof that you&#39;re a necessary and irrevocable continuation of the whole, rather than a part. Not only are you made of star stuff, but stars are made of you-stuff. You are the universe experiencing itself, and the universe is simultaneously experiencing you. Creation is dependent on the union of the conscious and unconscious. By extension, your ego is not yours, it&#39;s that of the universe. The human ego isn&#39;t massive by accident."

We were not to become religious or Iive on earth independent from God but to have a relationship with our creator to walk with Him Love Him and worship Him and enjoy Him. He created all things and for His pleasure revelation 4V11. DONT KEEP LOOKING OUT THERE TRYING TO FIND ANSWERS. Look into the Word of God the Holy Bible and you will find all the answers that God wants you to know. PS 115v16 says the heaven even the heavens are the LORDS; But the earth He has given to the children of men. We need to know are boundaries. God gave man dominion over all the earth, man is to fill the earth and have dominion over all the earth and over every living thing. But man has wrecked and ruined it all because of his sin and rebellion against God but the Good news is repent and turn from our sin Jesus christ God&#39;s son left heaven came done to earth took upon Himself the sins of the world on a cross and died under the just judgment of God paying are debt of sin with His lifes blood, and rose from the dead on the 3rd day and ascended back up to the father and is now seated at the fathers right hand turn from your sin and trust what Jesus Christ has done for you upon the cross.

I think deep down, the human spirit rightfully wants to reject this line of thinking (as is seen in the comment section). As a Christian, I certainly don‚Äôt know all of the answers, but I do know that there is a God, He loves me, and my life does have significance and purpose!<br><br>I believe in the God of the Bible Who formed me in my mother‚Äôs womb, Who knows when I lay down and when I rise, Who knows my every thought, is intimately acquainted with all of my ways, and Whose thoughts of me outnumber the grains of sand (Psalm 139). You, dear reader, are also loved by Him!<br><br>The narrator was right though‚Äîwe will all die. Although this is a sobering thought, thinking about it isn‚Äôt entirely negative. Thinking about death pushes us to put our lives/choices in perspective. I think most of us think we‚Äôll live to be a certain age. Death always seems so far away. Really though, we could die any day. No one knows when their last breath will be. <br><br>As a Christian, I believe that we will all face our Creator after we die. I believe the only way to heaven (and the only way to escape hell) is through faith in Jesus Christ, who died for our sins and rose again, a free and precious gift. I find peace through my faith in Jesus Christ. No matter how bad things get, my eternal future is secure in Him. That is what is most important in this life and nothing can change that. I hope that you, dear reader, will find the same hope in Him."

@rodneyking4183,2022-06-19T02:53:33Z,2022-06-19T02:55:06Z,0,"At least he finally got one thing right that I have been telling people for years. When you die, that&#39;s it. Heaven? It&#39;s Santa Clause for adults. It does not exist, and anyone that tells you that you have to believe is so full of crap. Prove that Heaven exists. You can&#39;t. There is a reason you can&#39;t prove it. No one has ever come back from Heaven with proof. Neil DeGrasse Tyson told us that now in emergency rooms there is a sign with words or a picture above the operation table. It&#39;s there for you to tell them about if you have an out of body experience or &quot;die&quot; and come back. No one who saw heaven has ever been able to tell the doctors what the sign on the ceiling was while they were dead. I think that&#39;s what he said in another YouTube video."

Like, where the fuck is the title to the 2020 Ford Escape that I paid $300 to transfer to Wichita&#39;s CarMax from a CarMax in Indianapolis and waited for almost 2 weeks for, just to save $3000 over the same exact Escape that Rusty Eck Ford had and still has in their lot? Should I just go buy the one at Rusty Eck Ford? Only if they will match CarMax. I have waited this long, a few more days will definitely not make a single difference."

This video ignores how it all started and how we came to be.  It ignores where the information our bodies need to start and remain livings.  It even ignores the Big Bang.  The truth is that God created us.  God created you.  God loves you / us even though you / we keep doing the things God does not like and warns us not to do because it is bad for us.  Yes, God created the universe and the earth for us but he also created Heaven for us.  Yes, life is rough at times on earth but when we get to heaven we appreciate it even more.  You were created and are loved.  And you are not alone."

The fact that you can care about something so small in this gigantic place must mean it means the world to you. Then again the word is a &quot;tiny&quot; place. A tiny place I hold dear in my big heart along with everything I care about in this tiny world. It is what makes us human.

U are one person who is unique only to a certain point, others in history have been through everything u have been through. You are not special and u will be forgotten no matter how famous you are.  When you put things into the scope of universal it really emphasizes how small you really are. Other planets other lives things we could never dream of are happening at this moment some where. So when u look at it like that remember stop worrying so much and live in the moment this is all u have it‚Äôs all u will ever have. Each choice made is one that was made on limited time. Death is inevitable so do what makes u happy and fulfills you: suffering is also inevitable it puts into perspective what beauty is. Appreciate what u have but do not settle"

Is she lost and scared? Has she been trapped someplace by a dangerous predator? (We&#39;re in coyote country.) Has she been caught by animal control? Is she alive?

@sk00muh,2022-06-17T13:47:51Z,2022-06-17T13:47:51Z,0,"As morbid as this is, it‚Äôs completely true. The universe just happened, it was incepted by atoms and Star dust. The earth is the only planet we know of, in the infinite universe, with intelligent life on it. And that‚Äôs where this brings us, humans, we just happen to be a species who can feel things like nothing else can, we build significant bonds and become attached and love one another. But it doesn‚Äôt matter. It may sound morbid, I understand, but life was never supposed to happen, and nothing can prove that it even exists. So.. just live your life. Have fun. Do things. Get outside. Go places. Learn new things. Because if it was never supposed to happen, you might as well make the most of it, because if you compare the average human lifespan (70 something or so) to the timeline of the universe, the time you spend in it, it‚Äôs nothing, nothing but an insignificant fraction in a complicated number."

You start to see that others and yourself are living a delusion.  As you witness and hear of current events, there is a very sad reality that overshadows people of every nation. Certainly all of the politicians fail in taking care of the needs and livelihood of the people. All around many of us are downtrodden and broken hearted. Discouraged, in despair, lost without answers, we almost die daily, unless we can find the Way.<br><br>You ask yourself, What or Who can save us, and How?<br><br>First I want you to know, that God Loves you, and cares specifically about your life personally. I‚Äôm not saying that as some clich√©. If you have never known the One true God YaHWeH, above every other false gods,  it‚Äôs not a mere chance that you‚Äôre reading this.<br><br>So what is hindering goodness, Love, and truth from flourishing more throughout the world, and within our very own lives? <br><br>Well, It is the result of sin in our lives and in the world.  This is a spiritually fallen and destitute world that we live in.<br>ROMANS 3:23 ‚Äú All have sinned and fall short of the Glory of God ‚Äú <br>Everyone one of us is guilty before God the Father.<br>It is the evil , the wrong, the sin that each one of us has done such as, lies, greed, hatred, lust,  sexual deviate behavior, envy, stealing, arrogance, the worshiping idols,( Anything that we hold in high esteem above God can be an idol) etc‚Ä¶ no matter how small the sin seems to be, that separates us from God whom is Holy; God is Love and Spirit and is perfectly Good. There is a real spiritual Kingdom of Heaven where God abides and a real spiritual eternal hell for those who reject God and choose to continue remain in any sinful darkness. Without God and having a sincere personal spiritual relationship with Jesus Christ, we are all distain to eternal hell. <br><br>We need Jesus Christ to save us and to be the Lord and King of our lives‚Ä¶.But Why?<br><br>Because Jesus Christ is the Son of God who came from God the Father out of Love for us, to save us from hell that we all deserve by giving His own life as propitiation ( an acceptable offering, atonement  for all of our sins ) Jesus is the only one who lived a sinless life and is the only one who could be the Mediator between man and God the Father.  <br><br>JOHN 3:16-19  For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. 17 For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through Him. 18 Whoever believes in Him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God‚Äôs one and only Son. 19 This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but people loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil. ‚Äú <br><br><br>God Loves us, and does not want anyone of us to perish and wants us to be reconciled back to Him spiritually so God the Father sent His only begotten Son Jesus Christ to provide the Way with all Godly Wisdom and Power of the Holy Spirit. Jesus is Divinely God manifested in the flesh and dwelt among us. By His great Love, He paid the penalty, the ransom,  for our sins by dying at the cross for our sins. Anyone who believes in Him and follows Him will be forgiven, saved and receive eternal life.<br><br>If anyone humbles themself and repents, turns away from doing evil in their life and believes in Jesus, they will be saved by His Grace through Faith and be forgiven, because Jesus overcame sin at the cross; And He rose again from the dead, He is now alive in His glorified body. Jesus has the victory over sin and spiritual death.<br><br>Commit your life to Jesus Christ today and the Holy Spirit will guide you into all truth. Blessings ALOHA"

Say you try solve the problem of anxiety by not caring, but then life has no meaning so then you suffer more. If you chose to believe that life is essentially meaningless, then you would just die painfully. There would be no reason to get up, eat, live and experience things. If life is truly meaningless then why couldn‚Äôt you justify killing yourself? Without any meaning You won‚Äôt have any strength over the great challenges you will face in life. What if life were hell for you? Would that still have no meaning? If you think hard about it, would you really be able to deny that your own pain has any meaning? At that point it would be a cry of despair."

Doctors and nurses giving me scary wake up calls on changing my diet, religious fanatics telling me I need to believe what they believe in order to stay away from Hell, pessimistic media talking about how the world could end in my lifetime, and all that shit (excuse my language) in my life that&#39;s keeping me from enjoying life because my problem is that I take everything way too seriously and I even take life seriously and I have a hard time helping that. As a person on the Autism Spectrum, I have always had a difficult time distinguishing facts and opinions which is probably why I take life and everything else too seriously."
